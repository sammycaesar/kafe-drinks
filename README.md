## About The Project

![product-screenshot](./src/images/kafe-project.png)

If you've seen any Korean Cafe Vlog or have visited Korea, you'll know that they make the best drinks! Many people in the comments of a Youtube video beg for recipes. So, it only made sense to make a repository of cafe drinks that you can make in the comfort of your own home.
